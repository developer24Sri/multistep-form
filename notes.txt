what is BEM ?
Block Element Modifier
so it is just a basic methodology which is used to structure the naming the css classes in a structured format

Block - A block is a section or a component like say for example a navbar, a profile card, a header or a footer 
Element - A Element is children of block for example in navbar we can see navlinks and in profile card we can see images header and para
Modifier - A Modifier defines the appearence and behaviour of a block or element for ex: button-primary, button--disabled, checkbox--checked, color--yellow

ex: Profile card(block), Elements(profile-card__img, profile-card__title, profile-card__des), Modifier(profile-card__button--primary, profile-card__button--secondary)

for block use - profile-card
for element first mention the block name and seperate it with __ like this profile-card__img
for Modifier first mention the block name and seperate it with -- like this profile-card__button--primary
